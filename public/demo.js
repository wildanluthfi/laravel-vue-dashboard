They are different forms where it is possible to have similar forms; therefore the example is not parallel. It can be corrected in two different ways: we can make the first expression like the second, or we can make the second expression like the first.<br><br>\n                    I like to sing and to dance.<br>\n                    I like singing and dancing.'},{title:"Comparatives and Superlatives",content:"The comparative is formed with either <i>-er</i> or <i>more</i> and <i>than</i>.
