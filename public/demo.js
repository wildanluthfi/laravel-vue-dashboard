The following is an example of a sentence that is not parallel:<br><br> \n                    I like to sing and dancing.<br><br>\n                    The problem in this sentence is not the expression to sing, and the problem is not the word dancing.\n                    The expression to sing is correct by itself, and the word dancing. The expression to sing is correct by\n                    itself, and the word dancing is correct by itself. Both of the following sentences are correct:<br><br>\n                    I like to sing.<br>\n                    I like dancing.<br><br>\n                    The problem in the incorrect example is that to sing and dancing are joined together in one sentence\n                    with and. They are different forms where it is possible to have similar forms; therefore the example is not parallel. It can be corrected in two different ways: we can make the first expression like the second, or we can make the second expression like the first.<br><br>\n                    I like to sing and to dance.<br>\n                    I like singing and dancing.'},{title:"Comparatives and Superlatives",content:"The comparative is formed with either <i>-er</i> or <i>more</i> and <i>than</i>.

The correct answer is often a restatement of what is given in the passage, expressing the same idea as what is written in the passage, but the words are not exactly the same. To answer this question, you need to identify the key word in the question, skim the passage for the key word or idea, read the sentence that contain the key word or idea, and then eliminate wrong answers and choose the best answer from remaining choices.<br><br>\n\n                    The unstated detail question is the opposite of stated detail questions. The correct answer is often not stated or not mentioned or not true in the passage.
