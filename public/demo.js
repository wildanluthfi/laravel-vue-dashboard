The correct answer is often a restatement of what is given in the passage, expressing the same idea as what is written in the passage, but the words are not exactly the same. To answer this question, you need to identify the key word in the question, skim the passage for the key word or idea, read the sentence that contain the key word or idea, and then eliminate wrong answers and choose the best answer from remaining choices.<br><br>\n\n                    The unstated detail question is the opposite of stated detail questions. The correct answer is often not stated or not mentioned or not true in the passage.
