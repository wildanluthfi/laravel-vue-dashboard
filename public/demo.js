These sea birds never set\n                foot on dry land. (1) An estimated 200,000 breeding pairs live in about\n                40 penguin colonies scattered along the coasts of Antarctica. (2) Their\n                waterproofed feathers, flipper-like wings, and streamlined bodies make\n                them excellent swimmers and divers. On ice they can travel distances\n                up to 50 miles by “tobogganing”—gliding on their stomachs while\n                pushing with their wings and feet.<br><br>\n                (3) Emperor penguins breed during the Antarctic winter in some\n                of the world’s most severe weather conditions (temperatures of –80 F\n                and winds up to 112 miles per hour). Breeding during the winter\n                allows chicks to mature in midsummer when food is plentiful. After the\n                female lays a single egg, the male holds it in a fold of skin near his feet\n                for a two-month incubation period. During this time he huddles with\n                other males to keep warm. (4) The male moves very little and does not\n                eat, usually losing up to a third of his body weight. Meanwhile the females\n                go to sea and dive for fish so that when they return they can feed and\n                care for the newly hatched chicks. After the male restores his body\n                weight, both parents take turns caring for their young.<br><br>\n                The world’s emperor penguin population declined in the last 50 years\n                due to a period of warming ocean temperatures.

For example, are the conversations about some aspect of school life, or some type of social issue, or a trip someone is planning?
