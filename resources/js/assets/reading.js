      A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves in front of the Sun and hides at least some part of <br>
      the Sun from the earth. In a partial eclipse, the Moon covers part of the Sun; in an annual eclipse,<br>
      the Moon covers the center of the Sun, leaving a bright ring of light around the Moon; in a total <br>
      eclipse, the Sun is completely covered by the Moon.
      </div>

      <br>

      <div>
      It seems rather improbable that a celestial body size of the Moon could completely block out <br>
      the tremendously immense Sun, as happens during a total eclipse, but this is exactly what happens. <br>
      Although the Moon is considerably smaller in size than the Sun, the Moon is able to cover the Sun <br>
      because of their relative distances from Earth. A total eclipse can last up to 7 minutes, during which <br>
      time the Moon’s shadow moves across Earth at a rate of about 6 kilometers per second.

      While the bald eagle is one national symbol of the United States, it is not the only one. Uncle<br>
      Sam, a bearded gentleman costumed in the red, white, and blue stars and stripes of the nation’s flag,<br>
      is another well-known national symbol. According to legend, this character is based on Samuel<br>
      Wilson, the owner of a meat-packing business in Troy, New York. During the War of 1812, Sam<br>
      Wilson’s company was granted a government contract to supply meat to the nation’s soldiers; this<br>
      meat was supplied to the army in barrels stamped with the initials US, which stood for United<br>
      States. However, the country was at that time relatively young, and the initials US. were not<br>
      commonly used. Many people questioned what the initials represented, and the standard reply<br>
      became “Uncle Sam,” for the owner of the barrels. It is now generally accepted that the figure of<br>
      Uncle Sam is based on Samuel Wilson, and the US. Congress has made it off‌icial by adopting a<br>
      resolution naming Samuel Wilson as the inspiration for Uncle Sam.

      Most people think of deserts as dry, f‌lat areas with little vegetation and little or no rainfall, but<br>
      this is hardly true. Many deserts have varied geographical formations ranging from soft, rolling hills<br>
      to stark, jagged cliffs, and most deserts have a permanent source of water. Although deserts do not<br>
      receive a high amount of rainfall-to be classified as a desert, an area must get less than twenty-five<br>
      centimeters of rainfall per year-there are many plants that thrive on only small amounts of water,<br>
      and deserts are often full of such plant life.
      </div>

      <br>

      <div>
      Desert plants have a variety of mechanisms for obtaining the water needed for survival. Some<br>
      plants, such as cactus, are able to store large amounts of water in their leaves or stems; after a rainfall<br>
      these plants absorb a large supply of water to last until the next rainfall. Other plants, such as the<br>
      mesquite, have extraordinarily deep root systems that allow them to obtain water from far below the<br>
      desert’s arid surface.

      American jazz is a conglomeration of sounds borrowed from such varied sources as American<br>
      and African folk music, European classical music, and Christian gospel songs. One of the<br>
      recognizable characteristics of jazz is its use of improvisation: certain parts of the music are written<br>
      out and played the same way by various performers, and other improvised parts are created<br>
      spontaneously during a performance and vary widely from performer to performer.

      The earliest form of jazz was ragtime, lively songs or rags performed on the piano, and the best-<br>

      One of his regular jobs was in the Maple Leaf Club in Sedalia, Missouri. It was there that he began<br>

      <div>
      The idea of determinism, that no event occurs in nature without natural causes, has been<br>
      postulated as a natural law yet is under attack on both scientific and philosophical grounds. Scientific<br>
      laws assume that a specific set of conditions will unerringly lead to a predetermined outcome.<br>
      However, studies in the field of physics have demonstrated that the location and speed of minuscule<br>
      particles such as electrons are the result of random behaviors rather than predictable results<br>
      determined by pre-existing conditions. As a result of these studies, the principle of indeterminacy was<br>
      formulated in 1925 by Werner Heisenberg. According to this principle, only the probable behavior of<br>
      an electron can be predicted. The inability to absolutely predict the behavior of electrons casts doubt<br>
      on the universal applicability of a natural law of determinism. Philosophically, the principal<br>
      opposition to determinism emanates from those who see humans as creatures in possession of free<br>
      will. Human decisions may be inf‌luenced by previous events, but the ultimate freedom of humanity<br>
      may possibly lead to unforeseen choices, those not preordained by preceding events.
